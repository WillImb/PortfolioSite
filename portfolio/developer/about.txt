Hi, I'm Will.
I'm passionate about building video games, 3D modeling, programming and broadening my tech expertise.
My favorite to use is Unity and C#, but I also know, java, C++, javascript, python and more. 
This site serves to showcase all the awesome projects I've worked on, either solo or in groups. 
The site itself is a site I've programed all on my own. (I also have a template version, if others want to use, email me.)
My persoanl favorite is EcoSnap (you should play it). On top of programming part of it, I also modeled, rigged and animated the animals.
I'm always working on something new. 
Currently I'm messing around with C++ and OpenGL
